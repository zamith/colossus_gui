Getting Started
---------------

This repository comes equipped with a self-setup script:

    % ./bin/setup

Next you need to add credentials to a `.env` file, like so:

```
API_KEY="your-api-key"
API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

After setting up, you can run the application using another script:

    % ./bin/server
